# Results

`*.allmarkers`: contains all loci mapped in family maps for crosses A and B.

`*.consensus`: positions of loci in family maps for crosses A and B and consensus map.

`LGs`: Table identifying corresponding linkage groups across all linkage maps (sex-specific, family, consensus).

`*.loci`: Synteny mapped loci (per study).

`*.map`: Linkage groups/position information for loci mapped in sex-specific, family and consensus maps.

`*.mapped`: Comparison of genes, GO terms, number of synteny mapped loci per linkage groups and number of loci mapped to same location on linkage map.
